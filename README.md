# Wine-Quality-Prediction-Project-Classification-Models
This Python notebook is a Machine Learning Project that predicts red wine quaity with SVC, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. Include:
- Dataset
- Data Wrangling
- Data Exploration
- Guiding Question: build classification models that can predict wine quality and determine the top 3 important properties that can make a wine good
- Prepare the Data for Classification Model
- Modeling: Baseline Classification, SVC, Decision Tree, and Random Forest
- Feature Importance
- Conclusion
